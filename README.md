# microbial_genetic_algorithm
Simple implementation of a microbial genetic algorithm in python for a report.

Optimisation problem to be solved was to maximise "happiness" by allocating people to one of two locations
based on a simple interaction matrix.

Implementation followed by a report on the effects of crossover in genetic algorithms.
